# the Best E-Commerce Back End

## Description
I made the Best E-Commerce Back End.

This application works with API testing tools, such as: Insomnia.

This application is used to create tables for the user's inventory. The application can be used to review, update, delete the inventory via Insomnia.

## Installation
Run schema.sql on mysql. Then, run the server.js file in the root directory. Then run the index.js file in the seeds directory.
## Usage
When the user has followed the installation directions, the user can access the server via localhost:3001/ in their API testing tool.

The user is able to access the ecommerce_db through three routes: "/categories", "/products", and "/tags". For each route, the user may GET, GET by ID, POST or create, PUT or update, and DELETE into each table.
## Credits
A lot of credit should be given to my peers. They were very helpful, and I always seem to learn a lot from them.
